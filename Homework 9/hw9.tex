        I worked with Sahil Kuwadia and Ethan Yeung
    
        I did not consult without anyone my group member

    \question[2]{Suppose we have an optimal prefix code on a set $C = \{0,1,...,n-1\}$ of characters and we wish to transmit this code using as few bits as possible. Show how to represent any optimal prefix code on C using only $2n-1 + n\lceil \log n \rceil$ bits.}

    Since there are $n$ characters, there are $n$ leaves in the tree. Thus, there will be $n-1$ vertices within the graph, so the entire graph will contain $2n-1$ total vertices, thus $2n-1$ bits. The height of a full binary tree for $n$ characters is $\lceil \log n \rceil$. 

    We can say that to associate the members of C with the leaves of the tree, $\lceil \log n \rceil$ bits will be enough to represent all members. We know that no delimiters are required if each character is represented by a unique prefix. So, with $n$ leaves, it requires $n \lceil \log n \rceil$ bits to represent all characters.
    
    Thus, we can say that the total number of bits required to represent the optimal prefix code is $2n-1 + n\lceil \log n \rceil$.
