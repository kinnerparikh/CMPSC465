    \question[2]{Suppose we have an optimal prefix code on a set $C = \{0,1,...,n-1\}$ of characters and we wish to transmit this code using as few bits as possible. Show how to represent any optimal prefix code on C using only $2n-1 + n\lceil \log n \rceil$ bits.}

    Since there are $n$ characters, there are $n$ leaves in the tree. Thus, there will be $n-1$ vertices within the graph, so the entire graph will contain $2n-1$ total vertices, thus $2n-1$ bits. The height of a full binary tree for $n$ characters is $\lceil \log n \rceil$. 

    We can say that to associate the members of C with the leaves of the tree, $\lceil \log n \rceil$ bits will be enough to represent all members. We know that no padding bits are required because each character is represented by a unique prefix. So, with $n$ leaves, it requires $n \lceil \log n \rceil$ bits to represent all characters.
    
    Thus, we can say that the total number of bits required to represent the optimal prefix code is $2n-1 + n\lceil \log n \rceil$.

    \question[3]{Generalize Huffman's algorithm to ternary codewords (i.e., codewords using the symbols 0, 1, and 2), and prove that it yields optimal ternary codes.}

        \caption{Huffman's Algorithm for Ternary Codes}
        \KwIn{$f : f[1 \dots n]$}
        \KwOut{$T : $ a tree with $n$ leaves}

        $T$: empty tree;
        
        $H$: priority queue ordered by $f$;
        
        \For{$i := 1 \textbf{ in } n$}{
            insert($H$, $i$);
        }

        \For{$k := n + 1 \textbf{ in } \lceil 2n-n/2 \rceil$}{
            i := extract\_min($H$);

            j := extract\_min($H$);

            k := extract\_min($H$);

            Create a node $r$ in $T$ with children $i, j, k$;

            $f[r] = f[i] + f[j] + f[k];$

            insert($H$, $r$);
        }

        \Return{T}
    \end{algorithm}

    Claim: Huffman's algorithm for ternary codes yields an optimal ternary code. Every optimal solution has three least frequent symbols as leaves connected to an internal node of greatest depth

    Proof: Let $T$ be an optimal ternary code. Let $i, j, k$ be the three least frequent symbols. Let $r$ be the internal node of greatest depth. Let $T'$ be the tree obtained from $T$ by removing $i, j, k$ and $r$. Let $T''$ be the tree obtained from $T$ by removing $r$. Then $T'$ is an optimal ternary code and $T''$ is an optimal binary code.

    % Consider an optimal solution for $(f_1, f_2, \cdots, f_n)$ with $f_1, f_2, f_3$ the least frequent. Then the subproblem is to find an optimal solution for $(f_1 + f_2 + f_3, \cdots, f_n)$.
